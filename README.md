# My Autobiography


My name is Tatiana Hern√°ndez and I am from Ohio. Currently, I am a graduate student in the MAPSS program. Some of my research interests include:

* *Central American* emigration
* state criminalization of *deportees*
* public *perceptions* of violence and punitive anticrime measures

I am especially interested in studying political topics related to **El Salvador**:

My dad is from El Salvador and my grandma and uncle live in the city of San Salvador. You can find San Salvador close to Lago de Ilopango on the map. I also have an aunt and uncle that live in South Korea. I was able to get to know them better after college because I lived there for three years.
