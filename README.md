# Biography

My name is Mads A. Hoofnagle. I am 24 years old and I live in Chicago, Illinois. I am in the Masters of Arts Program in Social Sciences at the University of Chicago. I have lived in *four different countries*: The U.S., Ireland, Iceland, and Denmark. I speak English and French fluently and some Icelandic, as well. 

## Education

I have **two undergraduate degrees**: a B.A. in psychology and a B.S. in anthropology from the University of Iowa. I have a M.A. in Viking and Medieval Norse Studies from the University of Iceland. I also have a certificate in Irish Studies from the University College Cork in Ireland. 

## Academic Interests

I used to be focused primarily on archaeology, but have since moved away from that in my current education to study medical anthropology. I am writing my current M.A. thesis on cultural facets of depression in Iceland. 

## Hobbies and Extracurriculars

I don't have much time right now to pursue my hobbies and interests outside of school, but I play a lot of video games. Currently, I've been spending a lot of time on: 

1. Darkest Dungeon
2. Dead by Daylight
3. DOTA 2
4. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare

I also play in a Dungeons and Dragons campaign with some of my friends who live all around the world. We are currently hunting vampires! 

When it comes to staying in shape, I like to go for a run or do some yoga. 

Here is a picture of me playing DOTA 2 and having a beer:
