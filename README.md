# Greetings!  

My name is **Maya Krasovsky**.

![*This is me outisde, taking in the sunshine*](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63366598/79288701-0f46ad00-7e8d-11ea-9f5b-d4be6c0efdd7.jpg)

I am a second year in the College pursuing majors in *Sociology* and *Economics*. 

A little bit about me: 

- I have lived in Moscow for half of my life 
- I have a mini-poodle called Thompson 
- My favorite food is chocolate babka

I am excited to get to know you this quarter and to learn how to use R!
