# Who am I?

My name is *Betsy Priem* and I grew up in Minnesota. Former employment (dating back to early teenage years) includes:

* Mower of neighbor's lawn
* Gas station deli sandwich/pizza maker
* Bank Teller
* YMCA employee
  + Youth tutor
  + Tutor supervisor
  + Student Board
* Science teacher & Science content lead

## Current research interests
I'm currently pursuing a PhD in Sociology, and my main research interest lies in understanding the social aspects of the *climate crisis*. I look at how political parties evolved as more science became available on climate change, and the institutional processes that supported the parties ability to generate policies that would address or avoid the issue of climate change. Because of this, I often get labeled as a **political sociologist** or **environmental sociologist**.
