I am a MAPSS student studying European History - specifically German cultural and political history of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. At the moment I am studying the relationship between conceptions of regional, national, and religious identity as they relate to the German concept of *Heimat*, or homeland. My other academic interests include:

    - nationalism and national identity
    - sub-national or regional identity
    - mass political movements, particularly socialist/communist and far-right movements
    - borderland regions, particular between Germany and France 
    and the European Union 

## Outside of Academia
I also like to hike, watch soccer, play video games (especially grand stratedgy games! <https://www.paradoxplaza.com>), trying new recipes, and visiting friends in other cities and countries.  
Originally I'm from Buffalo, New York where I went to highschool and where my family still lives. I went to college at the University of Pittsburgh, and graduated in 2017. I then took language classes at the Goethe Institut in Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freiburg_im_Breisgau>) and interned in Stuttgart, Germany at the Heinrich Böll Stiftung (Heinrich Böll Foundation.  
I am taking this course for two reasons:

    1. Computer based analytics are being used more in historical research, and I have no previous experience with programming or computer modeling.
    2. I have been told that having some experience with programming languages can improve your chances of getting a job in the social sciences outside of academia.
