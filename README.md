## Introduction
![me](Michigan.jpg)

My name is **Boseong Yun** and please feel free to call me **Peter**! I am a first-year grdaute student studying public policy at the Harris School of Public Policy. I am studying to quantify gender inequalites in text, image, sound, and other kinds of unstructured data. Yes, I have a very long way to go. I have also started my own [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfv5YsyMCcQPNyT-g0cEYGA) which might be more boring than our new quarantine lives. I will try to be funny and use more English. Please do not hesitate to talk to me if you have any questions and it is really nice to meet you all! 

## Reflections

- *Github Workflow:*
This homework would have been impossible had it not been for the very instructive **video tutorial** uploaded on the course website. Specifically, it was hard to understand the dynamics of github and its versatilty with the R enviornment in forking, committing, pulling, and performing other commands. The video tutorial provided clear mapping to what and why I was actually doing by using these commands. 

- *Rmarkdown:*
I was able to experiment with  headers, emphasis, lists, images, and links mostly referring to [Rmarkdown-cheatsheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) provided by the R studio. At first, I understood the list as a data type but I quickly realized that lists were one of the syntaxes used in Rmarkdown. Also, it was quite challenging to embed a image because I had to think about how the working repository worked on the virtual _RStudio Server platform_ in conjucntion with Github. Mostly, the difficulty came not from Rmarkdown necessarily but from integrating Rmarkdown and Github into an integrated unit. I was able to find the answers by trial and error where I had to erase and re-create a whole new repository. 

- *Final Thoughts:*
As mentioned by professor Soltoff, I think it is important to _understand_ the underlying mechanics of Github Workflow and R. This exercise turned out to be a lot more rewarding than I had intially thought specifically due to the requirement that I comprehend the workings of these two systems.
