##**Introduction**

My name is Jordi Vasquez amd I am from Gainesville, Florida. I am a 4th in the College majoring in political science and also an MA student in the 1 year program in the Committee on International Relations (CIR) (*Joint BA/MA*). 

##**Academic Focus**
At UChicago I have focused on topics related to security and comparative politics. I am currently writing my MA thesis on U.S. alliance management with relation to Japan, South Korea, Turkey and Greece.

Since Summer 2018, I have also worked as a research assistant on a project on transitional justice after authoritarian regmies. The website for project can be found here: <https://www.tjdemstabilitylab.com>(https://www.tjdemstabilitylab.com/)

As a part of this project I have:
* Researched the fates of authoritarian elites
* Researched the occurrence of transitional justice events
* Coded these events based on whether they targeted leaders or order-followers
* Created datasets with this data in Excel
* Analyzed these datasets in STATA

Thank you for reading my introduction/biography.
