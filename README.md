## Diana Reed

### now
Hi, I'm Diana Reed, a **MAPSS** student in Education and Society. A former Boston public school teacher, I'm now trying to "homeschool" my own two CPS kids, a 4th grader and an 8th grader, while finishing my thesis. We'll see how this goes!

### then
During other stages of my career, I've been an assessment developer, a project manager for large-scale assessments, and (briefly) a software engineer. Last year we all lived in Barcelona for half the school year, but we're now settled on the North side of Chicago for the *foreseeable* future. 

Here's a picture of me (with my daughter clumsily cropped out):

Some things we've baked during lockdown: 
1. gingerbread 
    1. https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1012460-dark-molasses-gingerbread-with-whipped-cream would recommend. very moist and not too sweet. add some extra ginger and candied ginger
1. easter egg bread    
    1. https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/easter-egg-bread/ did not come out too well with gluten free flour. noticed too late that the "all-purpose flour" I was using was basically ground fava beans
1. red velvet cake 
    1. https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/southern-red-velvet-cake-recipe-2011892 the buttermilk makes it
