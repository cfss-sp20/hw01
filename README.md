## Maria Benavides Bio
***
I was born in Bogota, Colombia. I consider myself a policy professional with international experience in social development, specifically in **childhood development and education**. I am skilled at decomposing, analyzing, and evaluating policy issues to devise possible solutions; for instance, I built new quality measurement tools for early childhood education services in Colombia, which the Ministry of National Education later piloted and adopted in 300 municipalities.

I have cultivated a new interest in the intersection between conflict and childhood development; looking for professional opportunities that allow me to apply her social policy expertise within violent and conflict contexts.

Now, on a more *personal level*, I love dogs. Back in Colombia I had the cutest mix breed dog, her name is Pepper. My parents are taking care of her. Here is a picture of her lovely face.
