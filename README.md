### GitHub Reflections:
- **To start**, I was completely lost with the setup until I watched the workflow video, which allowed me to get to the 'My name is Shawn Kim' step of the HW (as well as uploading the homework).
- **Then**, I had trouble initializing Markdown and subsequently watched some YouTube videos to help but to no avail. A mistake I made was changing the README.md file into an Rmd file. After working and testing with Rmd, I realized that this it is not necessary.
- **Next**, I utilized the helpful [Markdown guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to include four examples.
- **The most difficult step** was adding an image. I tried many methods I could find online (YouTube, stack overflow, etc.) but none seemed to work. I was messing around with myrepo to the point where I could not even upload the simple 'My name is...' step. So, I had to delete the entire repository and start from scratch.
- **If** anyone can offer help with embedding an image, please let me know!
