Hi, I'm Diana Reed, a **MAPSS** student in Education and Society. A former Boston public school teacher, I'm now trying to >homeschool> my own two CPS kids, a 4th grader and an 8th grader.

During other stages of my career, I've been an assessment developer, a project manager for large-scale assessments, and (briefly) a software engineer. Last year we all lived in Barcelona for half the school year, but we're now settled on the North side of Chicago for the foreseeable future. 

Here's a picture of me (with my daughter clumsily cropped out):

1. gingerbread

1. easter egg bread    
  1. https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/easter-egg-bread/ did not come out too well with gluten free flour
1. red velvet cake https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/southern-red-velvet-cake-recipe-2011892 the buttermilk makes it
