## A Short Bio

![alt text](https://github.com/ksong814/ksong814.github.io/meeeeee.jpg) 

Hi! My name is *Kevin* and I'm currently a second-year at the College. I plan to study both **Computer Science** and **Sociology** and hope to do research in computational social science. On campus, I am involved with UChicago TechTeam, a civic technology service group part of the IOP. I love kimchi-fried rice, the *Sherlock* and *Elementary* series, and reasonably priced skincare.

Some fun facts about me...
* I am semi-related to a kpop star
* Julianne Moore once gave me a hug somewhere in Manhattan
* While living abroad, I made friends with many local shiba inus.

I have recently gotten into programming as both an academic interest and creative hobby, here is a Python project where I tried to draw pixelated versions of my favorite characters: https://github.com/ksong814/Pixels (run main.py, I hope it works on your machine)



## Workflow:

To test if I had a successful connection from RStudio to my github repo, I first forked the hw01 repo and copied the url. I then created a new project (from RStudio) and then added in the Markdown content. I had to google ways to add images to the README, and ultimately I ended up uploading a picture in one of my github pages repositories (which I copied the url to get access the picture). I finished writing my bio, saved my work, tracked the differences, and committed the changes on the RStudio terminal console (I did so after configuring my username and email address). With integrated IDEs I notice that there are multiple ways to keep track of my work through git, whether that be through terminal commands from the console or more GUI approach the button options.
