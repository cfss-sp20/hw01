# Brief biography 

My name is **Sruti Kanthan**. I studied psychology in my undergrad, and I am currently a student in the _Masters of Computational Social Science_ program here at UChi. [Here is a link to my github page](https://github.com/skanthan95), where you can see my projects and repositories.
I was born and raised in New Jersey, have one sister, and a fluffy brown labradoodle named Beau. I moved out to MA after graduating college to work for two years, and then moved to IL for grad school. 

*My hobbies include*:
- Playing the violin
- Celtic or classical
- Cooking
- Trying out fancy food
- Hiking
- Singing and listening to music

__My research interests include__:
  - Sociocognitive development across the lifespan
  - Communicative competence
  - Predictors of romantic relationship health
  
#### Things I'm doing to stay sane during quarantine:
1. Watch new shows on Netflix
    - I highly recommend 'Wilfred'
2. Do online/virtual museum tours and attend virtual concerts
3. Just started playing video games from the '80s
                  
Here is the image I uploaded as my github avatar, embedded in this README: ![sruti](sruti.jpg). This wasn't working at first because the picture was in the wrong repo, so I moved it and now it should render.

Assignment To-do:
- [x] Header
- [x] Bold/Italic
- [x] Link
- [x] Image (had some issues with this, so list is my fourth element)
- [x] Lists
- [x] Marking complete/incomplete tasks (fifth element)

I included the "report your process" points when I submitted this assignment through pull request, but here they are just in case:

#### Getting changes into the README file wasn't too difficult overall - at first, I had some trouble pushing the assignment but then realized I was pushing to the wrong place, and I had some trouble getting the image to show up (turns out, it was in the wrong repo and I moved it to the right place and then it worked). I looked online for markdown resources on how to create headers and lists (like this site: https://github.com/tchapi/markdown-cheatsheet/blob/master/README.md). I knew how to make headers (use hashtag(s) before starting the sentence) and bold (* around the words * ) /italicize text since you can insert markdown chunks into Jupyter notebooks and I did this for my Python-based classes - though, I remember that it was tricky figuring out how spacing works, because some of the elements requested won't show up right if the spacing is off. I haven't worked with the Github workflow in the context of Markdown before, and I'm glad it's not too complicated - the assignment video explains everything very clearly, though I can imagine the terminology (e.g., "commit") being overwhelming for folks who haven't used it in other classes before. Overall, I think this assignment is a good starting point for getting comfortable using Markdown and understanding how Git works.
