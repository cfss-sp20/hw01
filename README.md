## Hello!

My name is **Yirou Fang**. 
I'm a first year MAPSS student with a concentration in *psychology*.
This is a really helpful and fun class for me because currently, I'm doing a study in parenting behavior and children's learning through [Amazon Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com), and there will be a lot of necessary data visualization needed for my project.

>Excited!

+ Ice cream
+ Chips
  - all flavors
