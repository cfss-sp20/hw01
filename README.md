### PROCESS
This was my first time using GitHub and while it was a little challenging at first, reading all of the information availible on the CFSS course website helped me immensely. 

**These were my steps to get changes into README.md on GitHub** 
1. Forked the hw01 repository
2. Cloned the fork onto my computer by creating a version control project
3. Made changes to the README.md by adding my biography and homework process
4. Committed my changes in R Studio
5. Pushed my changes to GitHub
6. Made a pull request to submit my homework

I don't know how often I should be committing changes, for this assignment I could do this in one sitting so I only committed once. But let me know if I should be committing more often, based on X amount of lines of code written or X amount of time spent working.
