# Welcome ! 
My name is **Mira** Joseph and I'm a second year Sociology/Literature student in the College. 

### Interests

I am interested in urban walkability, cool maps, Frederic Nietzsche, and Marx; for my BA in  sociology I am considering specializing in either social stratification or the sociology of disaster. During this period of quarantine, I am at home in ~~the greater~~ Boston ~~area.~~

* getting a progressively more ~~unpleasant~~ _strange_ music taste thanks to spotify's wacky algorithms 

* reading _harry potter and the methods of rationality_
