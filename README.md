## **About Me**

Hello, My name is **Tianhong Yin**, an MA student in international relations at the University of Chicago.

My research interests include:
Conflict Studies
American Foreign Policy
American Politics
Quantitative Methodology

I am a cat person and I love to know everything about cats during my spare time. Here is the link to a cat forum I often visit to learn how to care cats.

I also have two cats in my home back in China, and below is their photo.
