Hi, I’m **Regina**. I’m one part verve and two parts curiosity.

A former journalist turned social scientist, I am now  pursuing a masters in Computational Social Science from the University of Chicago to explore information dissemination online.

### Work
Before academia, I worked as the Product Marketer for the data analytics platform <a href="https://www.scraawl.com/">Scraawl</a> and collaborated on research projects for DARPA as a social scientist, researching the impact of fake news and bots.

### School
I have taken courses in statistics, modelling, and text analysis with machine learning. This quarter I'm taking:

* MACS 30200: Perspectives on Computational Research
* MACS 30500: Computing for the Social Sciences
* MACS 40100: Big Data & Society

In the past, I've completed courses in Product Management and Data Science from General Assembly. I’ve also won awards in both data visualization and video production. If you’re interested in taking a look at my work, check it out <a href="https://rkcatipon.com/">here</a>.
