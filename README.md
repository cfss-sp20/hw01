# About me
My name is **Chenyang He**. I am a MAPSS student concentrating in *Psychology*. 

# Research Interest 
I am currently working as an RA in Dr. Boaz Keysar's Multilingualism and Decision-Making Lab in the Psychology Department. 
Here's a link to our lab page:

We are dedicated to understanding the following interesting topics:
* Bilingualism and Decision Making
 * With millions of people worldwide using a foreign language everyday, how does language impact the way they make decisions? 
* Accents
 * What are the consequences of speaking with a foreign accent? 
* Figurative Language
 * How do people understand figurative language such as metaphors, idioms, irony and sarcasm?
