##A Brief Biography of Myself, Wael Taji Miller

###The Early Days

In the beginning, Little Wael grew up in a dirty and poor part of England called West London. In his early years, he demonstrated his potential through a number of impressive achievements, which include:

- Starting fights
- Rarely washing
- Being profoundly disagreeable
- Failing school
- Getting back into school
- Getting really good grades and stuff

Because of his impressive career background and talented skill portfolio, Little Wael was offered a place at the University of Cambridge, which is way older than your whole entire country and stuff (see Figure 1 for details).

###Getting Into Science
Little Wael soon evolved into his final form as Bigger Wael (though alas, he would never grow taller than [five feet and eleven inches in height](https://i.4pcdn.org/pol/1510707466870.jpg)). Although Bigger Wael acheived top grades early on in his humanities degree,[^1] he ultimately came to the conclusion that any debate on real-world issues that eschews evidence over anecdote and is unhindered by the burden of proof is much akin to playing World of Warcraft: there seems to be a lot of action going on, but the ~~lvlcap~~ goalposts keep expanding and you never really get anywhere. 

After that, Wael completed Cambridge and decided to quit the humanities forever. He got a scholarship to go to Peking University in China (which is also that country's oldest university) to study economics and neuroscience, and followed on by coming to the University of Chicago, as a PhD student in behavioral biology. Sadly, the University of Chicago is not old enough for bragging rights, but some experts believe this may change after several hundred years.



[^1]: The highest grade boundary in the UK is called a *'first'*, meaning First Class Honours, and the grade boundary below this is called a *'2:1'* meaning ~~total mediocrity~~ Second Class Honors. We avoid the GPA system because we in Britain are deathly afraid of decimals.
