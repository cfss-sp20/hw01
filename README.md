Hello!

My name is _**Luis Recalde**_. I am from Paraguay. 

I am a second MPP _(Master of Public Policy)_ student at the **Harris School of Public Policy.** My area of policy interest is International Development, broadly defined. During the Spring quarter I will be in Chicago, practicing self-quarantine (due to the COVID-19 pandemic) while "attending" and studying for my classes.

### **My favorite classes** #

In my two years studying a master's degree at **the University of Chicago** my favorite classes were:

*   **Program Evaluation:** a class that teaches different econometrics methods used to evaluate the impact of programs. 

*   **Cost-Benefit Analysis:** a class focused on tools to analyze the feasibility of projects through economic and statistical tools. 

*   **Survey Research and Methodology:** a very practical course that teaches all steps concerning survey design and analysis.

*   **Policy Lab:** a project-based course where I was part of a team that worked with the World Bank as a client on a project focused on survey-design.

*   **Any other class?:** while this is only the first week of class, I have heard a lot of great things about _**Computing for the Social Sciences**_, and I am very much looking forward to including it into this list as well! 

Thank you!
