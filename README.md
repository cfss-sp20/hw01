### Workflow Reflection
In order to get the changes to the read me file I committed the changes to my local repo by clicking the Git tab, checking the staged box, and clicking commit, and classifying my changes. I also pulled and then pushed my changes to Git Hub and then completed a pull request. 

In reflecting on the assignment, I think it was quite hard to set up the R studio and GitHub; there was a learning curve as well with forking the homeworking file and getting it to appear in R.
