### A Little Bit About Me!

My name is Lauren Park. I am a second year at the College, and am a Sociology and French major. I am from **sunny** Los Angeles. Also, I am on the women's varsity tennis team. 

##### These are a few of *my favorite things* to do in Chicago:
* Eating at new restaurants
* Running along the lake
* Exploring new neighborhoods
* Sitting on the quad when the weather is nice

Last but not least, these are some pictures I've taken. Definitely some of the **best** times I've had in college!
