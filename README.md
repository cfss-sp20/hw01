## Autobiography
My name is Olivia Padilla, and I am a third-year undergraduate studying Public Policy.  I am from a very small town in the rural Ozarks region of southwest Missouri. Here is a link to my town's webpsite. [link](http://www.cityofcassville.com/). In my free time I like to read, my favorite book is *The Phantom Tollbooth* by Norton Juster. I have three goals for this quarter: 
1. Practice social distancing. 
2. Maintain my mental health while doing so. 
3. Plan an awesome cross-country road-trip for when this is all over.  

## Process
1. I watched the video Professor Soltoff posted for this assignment. I made notes so that I could follow the correct process by myself.
2. I forked Homework 01's repository from the class GitHub to my own repository.
  + I cloned the fork to my computer and copied the repository's URL.
3. I opened a new project in RStudio Server.
  + I created a "Version Control Project" with Git.
  + I used the repository's URL to create this project. 
  + It took me a little bit to understand that the directory I was using to save this project was located within the university's server and not locally within my own computer. 
4. I opened the README.md file and typed this autobiography and process within the file. 
  + I referenced the R Markdown cheatsheet to add additional elements like headers, links, italics, and lists.
5. To commit the changes, I clicked on Diff and staged the file. 
  + I also added a committ message explaining what I changes I made. 
6. I pushed the changes up to GitHub and created a new pull request. 

NOTE: I did not click save in the editor before committing for the first time, so my first push to GitHub only included half of my edits. I have now clicked save and will committ and push everything again.
