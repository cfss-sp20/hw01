## **About Me**

Hello, My name is **Tianhong Yin**, an MA student in international relations at the University of Chicago.

My **research interests** include:
* Conflict Studies
* American Foreign Policy
* American Politics
* Quantitative Methodology

I am a cat person and I love to know everything about cats during my spare time. Here is the [link to a cat forum](http://thecatsite.com) I often visit to learn about cats.

I also have two cats in my home back in China, and below is their photo.
