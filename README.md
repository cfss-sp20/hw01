## **Biography**
Hello, my name is Maeliss Villepontoux. I am a student in the MAPSS program concentrating in political theory. I am originally from France though I have moved around a lot in my lifetime! I am currently quarantining with my family in Germany. 
### My list
Here is a list of indoor activities that I would recommend for staying sane during the quarantine:
* Jigsaw puzzles
* Crossword puzzles
* Zoom calls with friends
* Long walks outside
* Coloring 
* Practicing an instrument
Here is a picture of me the first time I tried girl scout cookies
