Hi there! I'm a third year at UChicago majoring in Economics and (hopefully) minoring in Computer Science. Outside of school, I like to follow politics (although usually it is not this depressing :( rip Bernie 2020) and listening to podcasts in my spare time. I'm also hoping to get back into reading more - I'm currently reading Go Set a Watchman by Harper Lee. (Did you know that Go Set a Watchman is basically the first draft of To Kill a Mockingbird? Very interesting seeing how the characters changed between the draft and the final product.) Here's some of my favorite stuff below:

__Favorite TV Shows__
* The Good Place
* Brooklyn Nine Nine
* Fleabag

**Favorite Ice Cream Flavors**
1. Cookies & Cream
2. Cookie Dough
3. Vanilla
