## Intro 
Hello! My name is **Emma Badia.** I am a student in *MACS 305, Computing for the Social Sciences.* I'm a fourth-year in the College majoring in public policy. 

## Why I'm In This Class 
I did my senior thesis for public policy on Chicago Public School's [Healthy CPS](https://cps.edu/Programs/HealthyCPS/Pages/HealthyCPS.aspx) program and looked at academic effects of implementing the policy for different demographics of CPS students. This required some coding, which I was able to do with *a lot* of help from professors and CS major friends. I want to learn how to do projects like this on my own, because seeing the results and going through the thesis process showed me that data analysis can be a powerful tool for analyzing policies and ensuring that they're implemented in equitable ways. 

## Some Fun Facts
Here are some fun facts about me:
* I am from [Louisville, KY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky) and am currently taking this class in my parents' house there. 
* I am fluent in Spanish and trying to learn [Catalan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_language). 
* I have one sister. People say we look like twins, but she is actually five years younger than me. ![I am the one on the right.](file:///Users/emmabadia/Desktop/MEandGABI.jpeg)

I think that's all the important information about me. I'm looking forward to the quarter!
