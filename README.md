Hello, my name is **Dinesh Das Gupta**. I am a Second Year in The College, studying Public Policy and Environmental Studies. I represent the Class of 2022 on College Council and sing with the a cappella group Voices in Your Head (Voices).  Voices released an album last year titled  *Begin Again*.  I am studying from Washington, DC, my hometown. I took a gap year before attending UChicago and during that time I worked for:
    
* The Institute of International Finance
    + Here I analysed capital flows in Excel.
* The Energy and Resources Institute
    + I helped organize the World Sustainable Development Summit.
* Goodwin for DC Council-at-Large
    + I ran campaign operations for my local Ward.
