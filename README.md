# Diana Reed

Hi, I'm Diana Reed, a **MAPSS** student in Education and Society. A former Boston public school teacher, I'm now trying to help homeschool my own two CPS kids, a 4th grader and an 8th grader. During other stages of my career, I've been an assessment developer, a project manager for large-scale assessments, and (briefly) a software engineer. Last year we all lived in *Barcelona* for half the school year, but we're now settled on the North side of *Chicago* for the foreseeable future. 

Here's a picture of me (with my daughter clumsily cropped out):
