I am an anthropologist by training, but I enjoy learning new methods and techniques. At the University of Chicago, I focus primarily on child labor in Cambodia and youth's rights. 

Outside of academia, I also:

1. Love to sing all the time, even though I'm not very good
2. Am great at eating any and all food, but terrible at cooking any and all food
3. Enjoy spending time with friends and family and meeting new people
