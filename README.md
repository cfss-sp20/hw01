## General Bio
Hello, my name is Jackson (though I go by Jay) Gibbs. I am a fourth year quadruple major studying:
* East Asian Languages and Civilizations 
* Public Policy
* Political Science
* Comparitive Race and Ethnic Studies

### Why I am taking the course
I've always had an interest in the data side to Public Policy and social science. That being said, I am *very* inexperienced when it comes to using R and Stata for more than the basic regressions and things Public Policy majors do in some of the required classes. Given that, a large part of my interest is in **learning the quantitative side** as oppossed to the qualitative side of data analysis. 

### Where I hope to use what I learn
One main place I have had to do a lot of analysis recently is for my BA thesis looking at Black female informal labor markets. While there is a good deal of analysis in that papper, every single bit of it (with the exception of one regression) was done using Excel. I got a chance to present it at the BA symposium a few weeks back:

It will probably be too late to use a lot of this for my BA, but I also currently do data work at NORC (sadly in SAS recently) so hopefully I can get a bit better at my job too. 

### Extra Stuff
Outside of class, my main quarantine hobbies are cooking and music. If you have any desire to listen to 8 hours of Lofi, you can check out [a playlist of mine](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4dR83FtiaGjDB6aoaXyiz5?si=vsKDmQxxTXa3ZB7xgH5TTw)
Hope it's a fun quarter!
