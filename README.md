# My Autobiography


My name is Tatiana Hern√°ndez and I am from Ohio. Currently, I am a graduate student in the MAPSS program. Some of my current research interests include:

* Central American emigration
* state criminalization of deportees
* public *perceptions* of violence and punitive anticrime measures

I am especially interested in studying political topics related to **El Salvador**:

My grandma and my uncle live in the city of San Salvador. I also have an aunt and an uncle that live in South Korea. I was able to get to know them better after college because I lived there for three years. In the future I would like to travel more.
